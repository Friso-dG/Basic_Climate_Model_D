# Basic Climate Model (Group D)
Basic Climate Model for Group D of the London NERC DTP Statistics and Modelling Course, this repo should hold all of the code for the two models. Both the R model (built by Ruben) and the Python model (built by Davide). Not entirely sure why there are two models but here we are I guess.
